Plan for 'Structure of the UN treaties diffusion'

Step 1. Identify clusters within UN treaties documents using
(ex. using hierarchical topic modeling approach). One of the options is to use 
beta version of Consilience software
(by Merce Crosas, Gary King, Brandon Stewart, and Justin Grimmer).

Step 2. Examine the effect of the clusters on the diffusion network. For example,
we might expect that treaties that involve human rights issues are more likely to be 
diffused than military treaties.
